# lapis

lapis (LiDAR API Services) is a small python wrapper that allows users to programmatically search for lidar collections across contiguous United States (CONUS) cross-referencing various lidar inventories.

Currently it uses US Interagency Elevation Inventory REST API services and NOAA's data access viewer to compile the most update inventory of lidar collections and locations of EPT files (Entwine Point Tiles).

Use case is to develop programmatic lidar inventory and improve accessibility so it can support tools and models.
